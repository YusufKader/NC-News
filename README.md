# How to create the environment variables to clone this project and run it locally.

You will need to create two .env files for your project: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=<database_nc_news>, PGDATABASE=<database_nc_news_test>, which is the correct database name for that environment. Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
